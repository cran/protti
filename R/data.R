#' Rapamycin 10 uM example data
#'
#' Rapamycin example data used for the vignette about binary control/treated data. The data was
#' obtained from \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18071-x}{Piazza 2020}
#' and corresponds to experiment 18. FKBP1A the rapamycin binding protein and 49 other randomly
#' sampled proteins were used for this example dataset. Furthermore, only the DMSO control and the
#' 10 uM condition were used.

#' Rapamycin example data used for the vignette about dose response data. The data was obtained
#' from \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18071-x}{Piazza 2020} and corresponds
#' to experiment 18. FKBP1A the rapamycin binding protein and 39 other randomly sampled proteins
#' were used for this example dataset. The concentration range includes the following points:
#' 0 (DMSO control), 10 pM, 100 pM, 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 uM, 10 uM and 100 uM.

#' Structural analysis example data
#'
#' Example data used for the vignette about structural analysis. The data was obtained from
#' \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420316913}{Cappelletti 2021}
#' and corresponds to two separate experiments. Both experiments were limited proteolyis coupled to
#' mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) experiments conducted on purified proteins. The first protein is
#' phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (pgk) and it was treated with 25mM 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PG).
#' The second protein is phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase (ptsI) and it was treated
#' with 25mM fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP). From both experiments only peptides belonging to
#' either protein were used for this data set. The ptsI data set contains precursor level data
#' while the pgk data set contains peptide level data. The pgk data can be obtained from
#' supplementary table 3 from the tab named "pgk+3PG". The ptsI data is only included as raw data
#' and was analysed using the functions of this package.
