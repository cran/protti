#' Fitting four-parameter dose response curves (using parallel processing)
#'
#' This function is a wrapper around \code{fit_drc_4p} that allows the use of all system cores for
#' model fitting. It should only be used on systems that have enough memory available. Workers can
#' either be set up manually before running the function with \code{future::plan(multiprocess)} or
#' automatically by the function (maximum number of workers is 12 in this case). If workers are set
#' up manually the number of cores should be provided to \code{n_cores}. Worker can be terminated
#' after completion with \code{future::plan(sequential)}. It is not possible to export the
#' individual fit objects when using this function as compared to the non parallel function as
#' they are too large for efficient export from the workers.
#'
#' @details If data filtering options are selected, data is filtered based on multiple criteria.
#' In general, curves are only fitted if there are at least 5 conditions with data points present
#' to ensure that there is potential for a good curve fit. Therefore, this is also the case if no
#' filtering option is selected. Furthermore, a completeness cutoff is defined for filtering. By
#' default each entity (e.g. precursor) is filtered to contain at least 70% of total replicates
#' (adjusted downward) for at least 50% of all conditions (adjusted downward). This can be adjusted
#' with the according arguments. In addition to the completeness cutoff, also a significance cutoff
#' is applied. ANOVA is used to compute the statistical significance of the change for each entity.
#' The resulting p-value is adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method and a cutoff of q <= 0.05
#' is applied. Curve fits that have a minimal value that is higher than the maximal value are
#' excluded as they were likely wrongly fitted. Curves with a correlation below 0.8 are not passing
#' the filtering. If a fit does not fulfill the significance or completeness cutoff, it has a
#' chance to still be considered if half of its values (+/-1 value) pass the replicate completeness
#' criteria and half do not pass it. In order to fall into this category, the values that fulfill
#' the completeness cutoff and the ones that do not fulfill it need to be consecutive, meaning
#' located next to each other based on their concentration values. Furthermore, the values that
#' do not pass the completeness cutoff need to be lower in intensity. Lastly, the difference
#' between the two groups is tested for statistical significance using a Welch's t-test and a
#' cutoff of p <= 0.1 (we want to mainly discard curves that falsly fit the other criteria
#' but that have clearly non-significant differences in mean). This allows curves to be considered
#' that have missing values in half of their observations due to a decrease in intensity. It can
#' be thought of as conditions that are missing not at random (MNAR). It is often the case that
#' those entities do not have a significant p-value since half of their conditions are not
#' considered due to data missingness.
#'
#' The final filtered list is ranked based on a score calculated on entities that pass the filter.
#' The score is the negative log10 of the adjusted ANOVA p-value scaled between 0 and 1 and the
#' correlation scaled between 0 and 1 summed up and divided by 2. Thus, the highest score an
#' entity can have is 1 with both the highest correlation and adjusted p-value. The rank is
#' corresponding to this score. Please note, that entities with MNAR conditions might have a
#' lower score due to the missing or non-significant ANOVA p-value. You should have a look at
#' curves that are TRUE for \code{dose_MNAR} in more detail.
#'
#' @param data a data frame that contains at least the input variables.
#' @param sample  a character column in the \code{data} data frame that contains the sample names.
#' @param grouping  a character column in the \code{data} data frame that contains the precursor,
#' peptide or protein identifiers.
#' @param response  a numeric column in the \code{data} data frame that contains the response
#' values, e.g. log2 transformed intensities.
#' @param dose  a numeric column in the \code{data} data frame that contains the dose values, e.g.
#' the treatment concentrations.
#' @param filter a character value that determines if models should be filtered and if they should
#' be filtered. The option \code{"pre"} is not available for parallel fitting of models. This is
#' because ANOVA adjusted p-values would be wrongly calculated because the dataset is split onto
#' multiple cores. Default is "post" and we recommend always using "post" because compared to
#' "none" only some additional columns are added that contain the filter information. For ANOVA
#' an adjusted p-value of 0.05 is used as a cutoff.
#' @param replicate_completeness a numeric value which similar to \code{completenss_MAR} of the
#' \code{assign_missingness} function sets a threshold for the completeness of data. In contrast
#' to \code{assign_missingness} it only determines the completeness for one condition and not the
#' comparison of two conditions. The threshold is used to calculate a minimal degree of data
#' completeness. The value provided to this argument has to be between 0 and 1, default is 0.7.
#' It is multiplied with the number of replicates and then adjusted downward. The resulting number
#' is the minimal number of observations that a condition needs to have to be considered "complete
#' enough" for the \code{condition_completeness} argument.
#' @param condition_completeness a numeric value which determines how many conditions need to at
#' least fulfill the "complete enough" criteria set with \code{replicate_completeness}. The
#' value provided to this argument has to be between 0 and 1, default is 0.5. It is multiplied with
#' the number of conditions and then adjusted downward. The resulting number is the minimal number
#' of conditions that need to fulfill the \code{replicate_completeness} argument for a peptide to
#' pass the filtering.
#' @param correlation_cutoff a numeric vector that specifies the correlation cutoff used for data
#' filtering.
#' @param log_logarithmic a logical value that indicates if a logarithmic or log-logarithmic model
#' is fitted. If response values form a symmetric curve for non-log transformed dose values, a
#' logarithmic model instead of a log-logarithmic model should be used. Usually biological dose
#' response data has a log-logarithmic distribution, which is the reason this is the default.
#' Log-logarithmic models are symmetric if dose values are log transformed.
#' @param retain_columns a vector that specifies columns that should be retained from the input
#' data frame. Default is not retaining additional columns \code{retain_columns = NULL}. Specific
#' columns can be retained by providing their names (not in quotations marks, just like other
#' column names, but in a vector).
#' @param n_cores optional, a numeric value that specifies the number of cores used if workers
#' are set up manually.
#'
#' @return A data frame is returned that contains correlations of predicted to measured values as
#' a measure of the goodness of the curve fit, an associated p-value and the four parameters of
#' the model for each group. Furthermore, input data for plots is returned in the columns \code{plot_curve}
#' (curve and confidence interval) and \code{plot_points} (measured points).
