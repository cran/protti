\title{Perform Welch's t-test}
\usage{
ttest_protti(mean1, mean2, sd1, sd2, n1, n2, log_values = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mean1}{Vector containing the means of group1.}

\item{mean2}{Vector containing the means of group2.}

\item{sd1}{Vector containing the standard deviations of group1.}

\item{sd2}{Vector containing the standard deviations of group2.}

\item{n1}{Vector containing the number of replicates used for the calculation of each mean and standard deviation of group1.}

\item{n2}{Vector containing the number of replicates used for the calculation of each mean and standard deviation of group2.}

\item{log_values}{Logical indicating if values are log transformed. This determines how fold changes are calculated.
Default is \code{log_values = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame that contains the calculated differences of means, standard error, t statistic and p-values.
}
\description{
Performs a Welch's t-test and calculates p-values between two groups.
